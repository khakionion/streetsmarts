Anti-Malware Guarantee
----------------------
I guarantee that Khakionion.com never hosts any software containing "malware," or software components meant to operate in a manner inconsistent with their labeling. This means ALL Khakionion.com software, prerelease or not, never incorporates adware or spyware to gather data without your knowledge. 

In fact, all Khakionion.com software is "self-contained," meaning they don't put files anywhere but their own directory, and don't even know about the registry, much less make changes to it. The Windows Registry is a Bad Thing(tm).
